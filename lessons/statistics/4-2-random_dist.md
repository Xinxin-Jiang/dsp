[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

### Verify if numbers generated by random.random are uniform between 0 and 1.
* Use random.random to generate a random sample.  
* Look at the pmf and cdf for the distribution.
```python 
sample = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample,label='PMF')
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample,label='CDF')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number', ylabel='PMF')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='number', ylabel='CDF')
```
![PMF](https://github.com/Xinxin-Jiang/dsp/blob/master/img/Pmf.png)
![CDF](https://github.com/Xinxin-Jiang/dsp/blob/master/img/Cdf.png)  
PMF graph shows that every value in the range [0,1) have the same probability.  
CDF graph shows that 10% of the sample is below the 10th percentile, 20% is below the 20th percentile, and so on.  
Therefore, numbers generated by numpy.random.random have a uniform distribution.
